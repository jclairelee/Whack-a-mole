# Whack-a-Mole

Whack-a-Mole is a classic arcade-style game implemented using HTML canvas for dynamic graphic rendering and JavaScript for interactive gameplay. This project provided an opportunity to explore the versatility of the HTML canvas element, demonstrating its capabilities in creating responsive and visually engaging web applications.

Players are challenged to test their reaction times and hand-eye coordination by swiftly clicking on appearing moles. Each successful hit awards 5 points, contributing to the player's score. However, hitting a bomb deducts 10 points, adding a strategic element of risk management to the game.
