# Whack-a-mole

Play Rule: By clicking, whack a mole before they disappear. Each hit earns 5 points, but watch out for bombs to avoid penalties.

### General Information

Creating this simple whacker game allowed me to delve into the HTML canvas element's functionality, learning its use for dynamic graphic rendering and manipulation on web pages. The game is a swift and challenging test of players' reaction times and hand-eye coordination, where they aim to swiftly whack appearing moles for points, earning 5 points per successful hit.

## Room for Improvement

- Incorporate power-ups that randomly appear, offering temporary boosts like faster whacking speeds or bonus points.
- Increase the challenge by introducing bombs or penalties. When a player hits a bomb, deduct points from their score and display a visual indicator like an explosion.
